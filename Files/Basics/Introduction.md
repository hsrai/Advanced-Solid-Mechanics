### Solid Mechanics

Solid mechanics is a branch of mechanics
that deals with the study of the behaviour
of solid materials under different types of
forces / loads.  The field is essential in
the design and analysis of structures and
machines, and it finds applications in
various fields of engineering, including
civil engineering, aerospace engineering,
and mechanical engineering.

Solid mechanics is one of the important 
branches of physical science concerned
with the deformation and motion of 
continuous solid media under applied
external loadings such as forces, 
displacements, and accelerations 
that result in inertial force in the
bodies, thermal changes, chemical interactions, 
electromagnetic forces, and so on.

Solid Mechanics is a subject which deals 
with how solid bodies raect ehen subjected 
to various types of loading. The main objective 
of this subject is to determine the stresses, 
strain, deformations in structures under 
actions of loads.

The behaviour of solid materials can be
studied at different levels, ranging from
the macroscopic level to the atomic level. 
At the macroscopic level, solid mechanics
deals with the behaviour of materials as a
whole, focusing on their overall properties
such as strength, stiffness, and toughness. 
At the microscopic level, solid mechanics
considers the behaviour of individual atoms
and molecules within the material, including
how they interact with each other and how
they respond to external forces.

One of the key applications of solid
mechanics is in the design and analysis of
structures and machines.  Engineers use
solid mechanics principles to design
structures and machines that can withstand
the stresses and strains they will be
subjected to during operation.  For example,
civil engineers use solid mechanics
principles to design bridges and buildings
that can withstand the loads and stresses
imposed on them by vehicles, wind,
earthquakes, and other environmental
factors.  Aerospace engineers use solid
mechanics to design aeroplanes and
spacecraft that can withstand the stresses
of takeoff, flight, and landing.  Mechanical
engineers use solid mechanics to design
machines and mechanical components, such as
gears and bearings, that can withstand the
loads and stresses they will encounter
during operation.

Solid mechanics also finds applications in
materials science, which is concerned with
the study of the properties and behaviour of
different types of materials.  By
understanding the behaviour of solid
materials under different types of stress
and strain, materials scientists can design
new materials with desired properties, such
as high strength, low weight, or resistance
to corrosion.  This has important
implications for a wide range of industries,
including aerospace, automotive, and
construction.

Nowadays, there is  great interest in the
use of computational methods for the
analysis and design of structures and
machines.  Computational solid mechanics
involves the use of numerical methods, such
as the finite element method, to simulate
the behaviour of solid materials under
different types of stress and strain.  This
approach allows engineers and researchers to
analyse complex structures and machines that
would be difficult or impossible to analyse
using traditional analytical methods.With the 
help of FEM, Analysing of complex structures
becomes easy by dividing it into smaller elements.
Some of the softwares used for Finite Element 
Analysis are Staad-Pro, Autodesk, Freecad, 
Ansys, Abaqus and many more.
